This mod adds a skill tree (albeit with only passive effects, because they're obviously superior to active ones) that contains:
* A whopping 36 skills, which I prefer to call "traits" by the way, 32 of which are class-related, each with 2 tiers
* An armor tier system that gives you the ability to improve the stats your armor pieces give! 


The points which you use to learn these traits have a 50% chance to drop from bosses, and a 10% chance to drop from enemies which are rarer than bound npc's (e.g. mimics and whatnot). 
You can reset any trait you've learned, but you DON'T get the points you spent on it back. 
To close the skill tree, you just need to either click on the coin-looking button again, or press ESC.

NOTE: it is currently incompatible with non-fullscreen window size.

This mod is compatible with virtually any other mods!
And feel free to report any bugs you might encounter.
